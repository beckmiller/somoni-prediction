# Prediction Tajikistan local currency
# :open_file_folder: Dataset

The dataset used is the [Beijing air quality](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data) public dataset. This dataset contains polution data from 2014 to 2019 sampled every 10 minutes along with extra weather features such as preassure, temperature etc. We decided to resample the dataset with daily frequency for both easier data handling and proximity to a real use case scenario (no one would build a model to predict polution 10 minutes ahead, 1 day ahead looks more realistic). In this case the series is already stationary with some small seasonalities which change every year #MORE ONTHIS

This is the time series analysis of Tajikistan local currency somoni (TJS). Here I used several famous predictions models such as Holt-Winters, ARIMA, SARIMAX and etc. Also tried to compare each other.
